"Customer Churn Analysis: Unveiling patterns and predicting churn in telecommunications data to optimize retention strategies."

## Overview:
Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers discontinuing services with a company, poses a significant challenge for telecommunications firms. This repository addresses the imperative need to explore data, identify patterns, and develop predictive models to mitigate churn rates in the telecommunications industry.

## Objectives:

- Explore data to understand customer behaviour and interaction patterns.
- Identify factors contributing to churn through data analysis.
- Develop predictive models to forecast customer churn.
- Optimize model performance by identifying and utilizing key features.
- Provide insights and recommendations for churn reduction strategies.

## Contents:

1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Scripts for cleaning, handling null values, and removing duplicates.
    - Outlier detection and treatment techniques.
    - Data smoothing methods to address imbalanced data.
    - Feature scaling for improved model performance.

2. Model Training:
    - Training of various machine learning models.
    - Utilization of lazy classifier techniques for model selection.
    - Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics.
    - Selection of top-performing models for further analysis.

3. Feature Importance:
    - Identification of significant features contributing to churn prediction.
    - Development of optimized models using only key features.
    - Analysis of model performance and computational efficiency.
